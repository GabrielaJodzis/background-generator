# Background Generator

This project is my interpretation of a small project from the **Complete Web Developer** course. It allows users to dynamically generate gradient backgrounds and copy the corresponding CSS code for use in their own projects.

## Features

- **Live gradient preview:** Instantly see the background change as you select colors.
- **Random gradient generator:** Generate random gradient combinations with a single click.
- **CSS code display:** View and copy the CSS code for the selected gradient.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for functionality (event listeners and DOM manipulation)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript while creating an interactive and visually appealing tool.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielaJodzis/background-generator.git
